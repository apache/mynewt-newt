Installing Newt on Windows
--------------------------

You can develop and build Mynewt OS applications for your target boards on the Windows platform. This guide shows you how to
install the latest release version of newt from binary or from source. The tool is written in Go (golang).

In Windows, we use MinGW as the development environment to build and run Mynewt OS applications for target boards. MinGW runs the
bash shell and provides a Unix-like environment. This provides a uniform way to build Mynewt OS applications. The Mynewt
documentation and tutorials use Unix commands and you can use the same Unix commands on MinGW to follow the tutorials. The
documentation will note any commands or behaviors that are specific to Windows.

This guide shows you how to perform the following:

1. Install MSYS2/MinGW.
2. Install Git.
3. Install latest release (1.6.0) of newt from binary.
4. Install latest release of newt from source.

See :doc:`prev_releases` to install an earlier version of newt. You still need
to set up your MinGW development environment.

**Note:** If you would like to contribute to the newt tool, see :doc:`../../misc/go_env`.

Installing MSYS2/MinGW
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

MSYS2/MinGW provides a bash shell and tools to build applications that run on Windows. It includes
three subsystems:

-  MSYS2 toolchain to build POSIX applications that run on Windows.
-  MinGW32 toolchains to build 32 bit native Windows applications.
-  MinGW64 toolchains to build 64 bit native Windows applications.

The subsystems run the bash shell and provide a Unix-like environment. You can also run Windows applications from the shell. We
will use the MinGW subsystem.

**Note:** You can skip this installation step if you already have MinGW installed (from an earlier MSYS2/MinGW or Git Bash
installation), but you must list the **bin** path for your installation in your Windows Path. For example: if you installed
MSYS2/MinGW in the **C:\\msys64** directory, add **C:\\msys64\\usr\\bin**
to your Windows Path. If you are using Windows 10 WSL, ensure that you use the
**C:\\msys64\\usr\\bin\\base.exe** and not the Windows 10 WSL bash.

To install and setup MSYS2 and MinGW:

1. Download and run the `MSYS2 installer <http://www.msys2.org>`__. Select the 64 bit version if you are running on a 64 bit
   platform. Follow the prompts and check the ``Run MSYS2 now`` checkbox on the ``Installation Complete`` dialog.
2. In the MSYS2 terminal, run the ``pacman -Syuu`` command. If you get a message to run the update again, close the terminal and
   run the ``pacman -Syuu`` command in a new terminal.

   To start a new MSYS2 terminal, select the "MSYS2 MSYS" application from the Windows start menu.

3. Add a new user variable named **MSYS2_PATH_TYPE** and set the value to **inherit** in your Windows environment. This enables
   the MSYS2 and MinGW bash to inherit your Windows user **Path** values.

   To add the variable, select properties for your computer > Advanced system settings > Environment Variables > New

4. Add the MinGW **bin** path to your Windows Path. For example: if you install MSYS2/MinGW in the **C:\\msys64**
   directory, add **C:\\msys64\\usr\\bin** to your Windows Path.

   **Note:** If you are using Windows 10 WSL, ensure that you use the
   **C:\\msys64\\usr\\bin\\base.exe** and not the Windows 10 WSL bash.

5. Run the ``pacman -Su vim`` command to install the vim editor.

   **Note:**\ You can also use a Windows editor. You can access your files from the
   **C:<msys-install-folder>\\home\\<username>** folder, where **msys-install-folder** is the folder you installed
   MSYS2 in. For example, if you installed MSYS2 in the **msys64** folder, your files are stored in
   **C:\\msys64\\home\\<username>**

6. Run the ``pacman -Su tar`` command to install the tar tool.

You will need to start a MinGW terminal to run the commands specified in the Mynewt documentation and tutorials. To start a MinGW
terminal, select the "MSYS2 Mingw" application from the start Menu (you can use either MinGW32 or MinGW64). In Windows, we use the
MinGW subsystem to build Mynewt tools and applications.

Installing Git for Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download and install `Git for Windows <https://git-for-windows.github.io>`__ if it is not already installed.

Installing the Latest Release of the Newt Tool from Binary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can install the latest release of newt from binary. It has been tested on Windows 10 64 bit platform.

1. Start a MinGW terminal.

2. Download the newt binary tar file. The link suggested below should direct you to the nearest mirror automatically. If it does not, go to http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/mynewt/apache-mynewt-1.6.0/ and manually choose the specific mirror site suggested for you.

   .. code-block:: console

    $ wget -P /tmp http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/mynewt/apache-mynewt-1.6.0/apache-mynewt-newt-bin-windows-1.6.0.tgz

3. Extract the file:

   -  If you previously built newt from the master branch, you can extract the file into your $GOPATH/bin directory. Note: This
      overwrites the current newt.exe in the directory and assumes that you are using $GOPATH/bin for your Go applications.

      .. code-block:: console

        tar -xzf /tmp/apache-mynewt-newt-bin-windows-1.6.0.tgz -C $GOPATH/bin

   -  If you are installing newt for the first time and do not have a Go workspace setup, you can extract into /usr/bin directory:

      .. code-block:: console

        tar -xzf /tmp/apache-mynewt-newt-bin-windows-1.6.0.tgz -C /usr/bin

4. Verify the installed version of newt. See `Checking the Installed Version`_.

Installing the Latest Release of Newt From Source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you have an older version of Windows or a 32 bit platform, you can build and install the latest release version of newt from
source.

1. If you do not have Go installed, download and install the latest version of `Go <https://golang.org/dl/>`__. Newt requires Go
   version 1.7.6 or higher.

2. Start a MinGw terminal.

3. Download and unpack the newt source:

   .. code-block:: console

    $ wget -P /tmp https://github.com/apache/mynewt-newt/archive/mynewt_1_6_0_tag.tar.gz
    $ tar -xzf /tmp/mynewt_1_6_0_tag.tar.gz

4. Run the build.sh to build the newt tool.

   .. code-block:: console

    $ cd mynewt-newt-mynewt_1_6_0_tag
    $ ./build.sh
    $ rm /tmp/mynewt_1_6_0_tag.tar.gz

5. You should see the ``newt/newt.exe`` executable. Move the executable to a bin directory in your PATH:

   -  If you previously built newt from the master branch, you can move the executable to the $GOPATH/bin directory.

      .. code-block:: console

       $ mv newt/newt.exe $GOPATH/bin

   -  If you are installing newt for the first time and do not have a Go workspace set up, you can move the executable to /usr/bin or
      a directory in your PATH:

      .. code-block:: console

       $ mv newt/newt.exe /usr/bin

Checking the Installed Version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Check the version of newt:

   .. code-block:: console

    $ newt version
    Apache Newt version: 1.6.0

2. Get information about newt:

   .. code-block:: console
