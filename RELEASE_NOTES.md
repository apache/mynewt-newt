# RELEASE NOTES

7 March 2017 - Apache Newt v1.0.0

For full release notes, please visit the
[Apache Mynewt Wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MYNEWT/Release+Notes).

Apache Newt is the build and package management system for the Apache Mynewt
project.  More information on Newt can be found
[here](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/mynewt-dev/201603.mbox/%3C56E21C13.9050303%40apache.org%3E)

Apache Mynewt continues to stabilize with each release, and we believe this
release is a further step forward.  People who are interested in playing
around, and trying Newt, are encouraged to download and begin evaluating it.

Future versions will add:

  * More robust package management and versioning

  * Plenty of helper commands for seeing what's installed, what's changed,
    and why things failed.

If working on next-generation build and source package management systems
sounds exciting to you, get in touch, by sending a mail to the Apache Mynewt
Developer's list, dev@mynewt.apache.org.
