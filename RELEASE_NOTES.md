18 October 2018 - Apache Newt v1.5.0

For full release notes, please visit the
[Apache Mynewt Wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MYNEWT/Release+Notes).

Apache Newt is the build and package management system for the Apache Mynewt
project.  More information on Newt can be found
[here](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/mynewt-dev/201603.mbox/%3C56E21C13.9050303%40apache.org%3E)

Apache Mynewt continues to stabilize with each release, and we believe this
release is a further step forward.  People who are interested in playing
around, and trying Newt, are encouraged to download and begin evaluating it.

Future versions will add:

  * More robust package management and versioning
  * Newt package type "transient"
  * Support for specifying C++ compiler flags
  * Improvements for info, size, sync and upgrade commands
  * Support for encrypted images
  * Support for multiple concurrent debug sessions with two boards

If working on next-generation build and source package management systems
sounds exciting to you, get in touch, by sending a mail to the Apache Mynewt
Developer's list, dev@mynewt.apache.org.
