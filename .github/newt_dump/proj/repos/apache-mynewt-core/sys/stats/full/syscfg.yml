        description: >
            The size of the buffer that holds each stat group during
            persistence.  Before a stat group is persisted, it must be
            base64-encoded in this buffer.  The buffer is allocated on the
            stack.  If the buffer is too small for a persistent stat group, the
            system detects the problem at startup and triggers a failed
            assertion.
