        description: >
            Retires the old `LOG_[...]` macros and redefines them to use
            modlog.  That is, if enabled, this setting allows the following
            code:
                LOG_DEBUG(LOG_MODULE_DFLT, "hello");
            This line logs the string "hello" to the default module using
            modlog.  This setting will be enabled by default in a future
            release.
