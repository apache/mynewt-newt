            It is recommended to leave this disabled unless using MCU without
            built-in cycle counter (e.g. Cortex-M0).

            Traces are continuously stored in cyclic buffer which can be read
            from the target e.g. after unattended system crashed unexpectedly.
            It is recommended to use large SysView buffer to get as much data
            for analysis as possible.
