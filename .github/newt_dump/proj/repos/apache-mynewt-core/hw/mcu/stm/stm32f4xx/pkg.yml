# Ignoring I2C from STM32 repository is hacky and awful, but we've been
# maintaining our own versions of these files awhile.  At least this
# leaves the cube SDK unmolested, as we now maintain our own copies of these
# files in our HAL implementation.
# I'm ignoring the files as the symbols would otherwise conflict -- this needs
# to be improved.
