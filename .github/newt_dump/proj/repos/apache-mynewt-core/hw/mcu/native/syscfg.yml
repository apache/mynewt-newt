    MCU_NATIVE_USE_SIGNALS:
        description: >
            Whether to use POSIX signals to implement context switches.  Valid
            values are as follows:
                1: More correctness; less stability.  The OS tick timer will
                   cause a high-priority task to preempt a low-priority task.
                   This causes stability issues because a task can be preempted
                   while it is in the middle of a system call, potentially
                   causing deadlock or memory corruption.

                0: Less correctness; more stability.  The OS tick timer only
                   runs while the idle task is active.  Therefore, a sleeping
                   high-priority task will not preempt a low-priority task due
                   to a timing event (e.g., delay or callout expired).
                   However, this version of sim does not suffer from the
                   stability issues that affect the "signals" implementation.

            Unit tests should use 1.  Long-running sim processes should use 0.
